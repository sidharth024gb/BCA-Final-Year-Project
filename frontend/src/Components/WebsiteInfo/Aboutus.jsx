        <p className="web-info-para">
          Founded with the vision of connecting individuals in a dynamic online
          marketplace, TradeConnect emerged as a solution to bridge the gap
          between buyers and sellers. Our journey began when a group of
          passionate entrepreneurs saw the potential of harnessing technology to
          create a platform that empowers users to trade goods and services
          directly with one another. From humble beginnings, we've grown into a
          community-driven marketplace that prioritizes trust, transparency, and
          seamless transactions.
